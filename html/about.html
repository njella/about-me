            <br>

            <section>
                <h4>Current</h4>
                Currently I am a Junior at Northwest Missouri State University (Maryville, MO) pursuing a
                <i>Bachelor's in Computer Science</i> (Expected Graduation Date: December 2020)
                <br>
                I am employed by Nucor-LMP here in Maryville, and am interning as an onsite PC Technician. My daily
                tasks consist
                of responding to help desk tickets, of which are submitted by the users on campus if they are having
                any issues
                with the technology that is provided to them. I have dealt with a list of devices, including
                personal computer's(laptop and desktop), two-way radio's, personal scanner's, handheld scanner's, tag
                printer's,
                and standard printers as well.

            <section>
                <h4>Background</h4>
                I have practiced with many different IDE's. Some of which are:
                <ul>
                    <li>IntelliJ IDEA</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Visual Studio Code</li>
                    <li>Netbeans</li>
                    <li>BlueJay</li>
                    <li>Notepad++</li>
                    <li>TextWrangler</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <br>

            <section>
                <h4>Plans</h4>
                After graduation I hope to move back to the Kansas City, MO area (where I grew up), and hopefully find employment
                in that area. If my job wishes to take me elsewhere that is definitely fine as well. 
                Right before graduating college I will have had a wedding the previous summer with my amazing fiance Taylor.

                <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
                When outside of the work and IT arena I am a very big competitor and sports fan. I not only will workout at a gym
                , but as well am always willing to play a pickup game of basketball, or go to any nearby disc golf courses.
                After playing sports my entire life (starting at age 4 and never ending until age 19) I would say that I have
                a huge competitive mentality and definitely push through to finish anything I can set my mind to.
